# Interactive Excel Dashboard Displaying Stats from a 2025 Golf Tournament

## Overview
I had little prior knowledge of Excel after my junior year of college, and wanted to learn how to use it for data analysis. I took an online course, and was then motivated to visualize some statistics from a golf tournament I played in July 2025. The dashboard allows you to select the hole number and see information such as highest score, average score, and the distribution of scores (pars, birdies, double bogeys, etc...). You can also select player to see their score distribution over the two days, and their score to handicap. Skills used include pivot tables, functions like MAX, and slicers.

## Dataset
The data was entered by hand after I collected around 60 scorecards after the two-day tournament. The data I entered included scores on each hole and handicap for the player.

### Results
I believe the dashboard turned out great! It is relatively simple but I think it looks clean and is easy to read. I plan on adding data to it next year after I play in the tournament again.

### Instructions
The dashboard comes in two separate sheets which can be navigated between at the bottom of the page. Data contains the raw data and pivot tables, while Hole Stats contains the dashboard. The dashboard allows you to select hole(s) on the left menu, and player on the right. You can also hover over indivdual bars or statistics to see more information.
